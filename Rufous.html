            <p>The symbol of the “golem” in Jewish folklore has been a meaningful concept to me since I began working with clay. A golem is a figure made out of clay that is activated through language–usually an inscription of the word “truth” on the sculpture’s forehead and a piece of paper with “name” placed in its mouth. They have been used to represent a myriad of  things, but are ultimately an exploration between a creator and their creation. </p>

           <p> One of the things that made me fall in love with ceramics was the feeling of giving a clay sculpture life. There is always a point in my sculptural process where I feel like my work crosses over from being an object to being an animal with memories and a personal history. This has heavily influenced my desire to focus on extinct and endangered birds. </p>

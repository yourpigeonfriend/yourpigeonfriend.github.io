            <p>On September 1st, 1914, Martha–the last passenger pigeon–died in the Cincinnati Zoological Garden at age 29. Passenger pigeons were an adaptable and abundant keystone species that made up an estimated 25-40% of North America’s bird population until they were a target of mass hunting in the mid 1800s. Large forested areas were essential for the Passenger Pigeon’s breeding and roosting, and the clearing of these forests for farmland pushed the pigeons into agricultural areas. The birds then fed on common crops and were considered both a nuisance and visually unappealing, which eventually led to mass hunting via shotgun and net trapping. Conservation efforts began in the late 1870s, but by then there were too few adult pigeons left to reestablish a healthy breeding population. Martha was the final known bird of her species and lived her entire life in captivity. Her death in 1914 marked an important turning point for conservation and protection of endangered species in North America.
Clay pigeon shooting is a sport that rose to popularity as live pigeon shooting began raising ethical concerns. Pigeon shooting as a sport often used captive bred homing pigeons, but is inseparable from the United State’s bird trapping and shooting history involving other species such as the passenger pigeon. Clay target shooting involves launching small talc-based discs (called “pigeons” or “birds”) from a machine (called a “trap") and shooting them midair with a shotgun. Successful hits on clay targets are often still called “kills” and missed shots are called “bird away.” The targets were originally made with ceramic clay, but were later replaced with a talc and petroleum-based pitch. </p>

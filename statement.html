        <p>Fragility haunts me–the fragility of my own body, the fragility of the dead bird in my hands. My time around ill-fated animals in agricultural and rehabilitation settings has shown me just how delicate life can be.</p>

        <p>Animals–most often birds–are the subject of my work. My upbringing was full to the brim with barns, fields, chickens, hawks, and game, which fostered an obsessive love for everything avian. Birds are resilient and bold despite their delicate, hollow bodies. They are storytellers and I am fortunate to be a listener.</p>

        <p>Clay is my medium of choice. Creating ceramic work has become a method of picking apart my relationship with the ephemerality of human and animal life. Clay is a fit partner for exploring this as every impression into the clay is reflected back into the maker–as I give life to my sculptures, the material bites down and shaves life off of me.</p>

        <p>It's hard to know why or how you’ve become an artist. I can trace my steps through childhood drawings and high school art classes, but truthfully, I think that my sensitivity led me here. I am deeply emotional. I am scared. I cried when my animals went to slaughter. I cry when I laugh. I see myself in the birds that litter the city sidewalks. I see myself in birds performing courtship rituals. I am an artist and a ceramicist and a birder, but above all I am an animal too.</p>

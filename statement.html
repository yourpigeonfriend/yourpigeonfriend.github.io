  <p> I remember the first time I stayed up all night. I was young and stood barefoot outside, watching the sun arch over sprawling, yellow fields. The fog glistened and whispered stories of the wide open sky. I heard melodies of mourning doves and the gentle dripping of dew. I revisit this memory time and time again–many years later, I still chase the level of curiosity and admiration that young Bird had for the sun and the earth. </p>

<p> The world’s stories live in quiet corners; a pebble, an old decoy, a dead bird, a window, a chipped corner. These things stay still and witness as the world flutters around them. Where did they come from and what have they seen? I make artwork about things and the stories they reveal to me. Due to the nature of my upbringing, these objects are often related to hunting, the rural landscape, birds, and patterns. </p>

<p> As a bird weaves twigs and twine, I weave coils of clay. My relationship with ceramics has become natural and compulsive. The ceramic process is a permanent part of my thought process–I often visualize the entire world in clay or have dreams of coiling up and up and up… </p>

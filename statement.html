        <p>Fragility haunts me–the fragility of my own body, the fragility of the dead bird in my hands. Every little bit that makes up the world is fleeting and delicate; tenderness and a gentle touch are important above all else. I engage softly with these things through listening and fathering my own quiet clay creatures. The endless curve of a hookbill is a reconstruction of my own hearing ear–my experience reflected back to me in the likeness of a parrot. </p>

       <p> Creating ceramic work is a way for me to pick apart and understand my own delicate body. Every impression into the clay is an impression into me–the material bites down on my lungs in return for my eternal fixture of its form. </p>

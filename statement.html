  <p> I remember the first time I stayed up all night. I was young and stood barefoot outside, watching the sun arch over sprawling, yellow fields. I heard melodies of mourning doves and the gentle whinnying of the neighbor’s horses. I remember the first time I killed an animal. A small trout was pinned down on  a wooden board while sweat permeated the wooden handle of the knife in my hand. My face got hot as blood spilled over onto my feet–speckled with eggs and dirt. </p>
        
<p> My relationship with the world is complicated, raw, romantic, and visceral. I grew up on a farm and learned about life, death, birth, and sex from animals. I have memories of slaughtering, mourning, aiming, and watching. Everything reminds me of something. As I live and experience more and more, old memories resurface–they warp and loop around my head until I can spit them out as ceramic objects. I memorialize the subjects of these memories with coils of clay and disjointed patterns, putting them to rest by giving them space in the physical world again. </p>
